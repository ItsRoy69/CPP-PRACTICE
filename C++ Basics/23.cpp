//Static Data Members

/* A static member is shared by all objects of the class.
All static data is initialized to zero when the first object is created, if no other initialization is present.
We can't put it in the class definition but it can be initialized outside the class,
as done in the following example by redeclaring the static variable,
using the scope resolution operator :: to identify which class it belongs to.*/
